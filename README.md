A Boggle-like variant, but with more options:

1. The board can be a subset of the euclidean plane as per usual Boggle, or played on the surface of a horizontal or vertical cylinder; a torus; a mobius strip; a Klein bottle; or a projective plane.

2. The game can be timed or untimed.

3. I plan on ranking game board so that players can play simultaneously or with the same board and rules without requiring any kind of connection.

This is predominantly an exercise in playing with tries, trie-packing, and learning JavaFX.
